                        July 2022-September 2023. I began this project in high school to explore the realm of compuational neuroscience. I was mentored by a graduate student at MIT who helped me structure this project and pointed me to research papers that could help me build a foundational knowledge.
                        From there, I explored over 15 different models and decided to hone in on two components: machine learning models and bio-circuit models. I learned how to code several of these models from youtube tutorials and explored these languages in my high school curricula. Attached is the abstract of the final project.
                        This was presented at the Polygence Symposium in September of 2023. From then on, I have adjusted the metrics used in the paper to account for learning experiences I have had since.
                        Please feel free to email me at krb2179@columbia.edu for access to the full project.
